# Convex-Hull
Computes the convex hull from a set of given points using Graham Scan.

-On coordinates / On-Click point placer

-Manual / automatic hull computing

-Random points generator

-Points / Convex points counter

-Coordinates display (note: this option must be selected before placing the points)


To Do Someday:

-implement different hull algorithms

-code refactoring
